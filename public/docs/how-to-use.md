# How to Use Explorer

Explorer offers several key features to help you evaluate Web3 privacy projects:

## Dashboard Filters
Use the dashboard to filter projects by privacy technology, category, and other attributes so you can quickly compare options.

## Project Submission
Anyone can submit a project through the editor. After filling out the form, a pull request is created in our repository for review.

## Review Process
Submissions are manually reviewed by the team. Once approved, the data becomes part of our public project database.
